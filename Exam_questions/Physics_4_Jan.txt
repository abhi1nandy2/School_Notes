1. Solve
a. Two lamps, one rated 100 W at 220 V, and the other 60 W at 220 V, are connected in parallel to electric mains supply. What current is drawn from the line if the supply voltage is 220 V?
b. Which uses more energy, a 250 W TV set in 1 hr, or a 1200 W toaster in 10 minutes?
c. An electric heater of resistance 8 Ω draws 15 A from the service mains 2 hours. Calculate the rate at which heat is developed in the heater.

2. Explain the following.

a. Why is the tungsten used almost exclusively for filament of electric lamps?
b. Why are the conductors of electric heating devices, such as bread-toasters and electric irons, made of an alloy rather than a pure metal?
c. Why is the series arrangement not used for domestic circuits?
d. How does the resistance of a wire vary with its area of cross-section?

3. Explain
a. How does a solenoid behave like a magnet? Can you determine the north and south poles of a current–carrying solenoid with the help of a bar magnet? Explain.
b. When is the force experienced by a current–carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field largest?
c. Two circular coils A and B are placed closed to each other. If the current in the coil A is changed, will some current be induced in the coil B? Give reason.
d. List two methods of producing magnetic fields.

4. Solve
a. Compute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge in one hour through a potential difference of 50 V
b. An electric iron of resistance 20 Ω takes a current of 5 A. Calculate the heat developed in 30 s.
c. Electric lamp of resistance 20 ohms and a conductor of 4 ohms resistance are connected to a 6 volt battery. Calculate total resistance, current, and potential difference across electrical lamp and conductor.
