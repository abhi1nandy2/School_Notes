A. By constant acceleration we mean that the object has uniform acceleration in
equal intervals of time however small the time intervals are.

7. A point mass starts moving in a straight line with constant acceleration
2 Ata time 't’ after the beginning of motion, the acceleration changes
sign, without change in magnitude. Determine the time to from the
