A. While playing tennis, we strike the tennis ball with our racquet.

force,
* The tennis ball is moving in your direction and it continues moving in yot

direction until you apply a force by striking it with the racquet.
(2) Acceleration equals force over mass (or) force equals mass times acceleratio
the more quickly it moves away from yo

* The harder you hit the ball,
because you impart a greater acceleration to it.
