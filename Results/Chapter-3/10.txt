A. From the conservation of linea

we have

(or) my, my ”

here m,, mass of first skater = 60 kg:

; = velocity of first skater = 2m/s

m, = mass of second skater = 40 ko

¥,= velocity of second skater = ?
Substituting the above values in equation
60x2 = -40xy,

A. Ifu =v ms%, v = -v msi, time = t seconds
(~ the ball moves in opposite direction)
Impulse = change in momentum

= my - mu = m(-v)-mv = -2mv

Force = Change in momentum _ —2mv

Soa force of 2™¥ acts on the ball due
to wall and the direction of the force being away from
the wall (reaction).
