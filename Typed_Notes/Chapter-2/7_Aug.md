Q. Consider a train which can accelerate with an acceleration of 20 cm/s<sup>2</sup> and slow down with deceleration of 100 cm/s<sup>2</sup>. Find the minimum time for the train to travel between the stations 2.7km apart.

Ans. 

v<sub>m</sub> = 0 + 0.2t (**Recall**: 20cm = 20/100 m = 0.2m)

Similarly 0 = v<sub>m</sub> - (1) t<sub>2</sub> => t<sub>2</sub> = v<sub>m</sub> (**Recall**: 100cm = 1m)

Total time = t = t<sub>1</sub> + t<sub>2</sub> = (V<sub>m</sub>/0.2) + (V<sub>m</sub>/1) = 5V<sub>m</sub> + V<sub>m</sub> = 6V<sub>m</sub>

Total Distance S<sub>1</sub> + S<sub>2</sub> = (V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>/0.4) + (V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>/2) = 2700 m  (2.7 km = 2700 m)

3V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub> = 2700

V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub> = 900

t = 6 x 30 = 180s

Q. A train of length 50m is moving with a constant speed of 10 m/s. Calculate the time taken by the train to cross an electric pole and a bridge of length 250 m.

Ans:

(**Recall:** Time = distance/speed)

**Note:** A train has to travel its own length in order to cross an electric pole, railway signal, a tree, a kilometer stone or stationary man.

Distance to be travelled = Length of train = 50 m,

Speed of train = 10 m/s
