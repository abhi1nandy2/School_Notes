1. "She moves at a constant speed in a constant direction". Rephrase the same sentence in a fewer words using concets related to motion.

Ans: The above sentence in a fewrer words can be written as -
		"She moves at a constant velocity".

2. In the figure given below, distance Vs. time graphs showing motion of two cars A and B are given. Which car moves fast?

Ans: Out of the two cars whose Distance - time graphs are shown in the figure, car A moves faster than car B as seen from the graph.

3. Derive the equation for uniform accelerated motion for the displacement covered in its n<sup>th</sup> second of its motion. (s<sub>n</sub> = u + a(n - 0.5))

Ans: Let S<sub>n</sub> be displacement covered, in the n<sup>th</sup> second of the motion of a uniformly accelerated body. Let its initial velocity be 'u' and 'a' be its acceleration.

The displacement of the body S<sub>t</sub> = ut + 0.5at<sup>2</sup> (formuala).

Displacement in n seconds => S<sub>n</sub> = un + 0.5an<sup>2</sup> ....(1)

Displacement in (n-1) seconds => S<sub>n-1</sub> = u(n-1) + 0.5a(n-1)<sup>2</sup> ....(2)

Subtracting S<sub>n-1</sub> from S<sub>n</sub>

S<sub>n</sub> - S<sub>n-1</sub> = (un + 0.5an<sup>2</sup>) - [u(n-1) + 0.5a(n-1)<sup>2</sup>]

= un + 0.5an<sup>2</sup> - un + u - 0.5a(n-1)<sup>2</sup>

= 0.5an<sup>2</sup> + u - 0.5a(n<sup>2</sup> - 2n + 1)
